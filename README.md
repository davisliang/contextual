# marsmission
We're sending a DQN to Mars. In two dimensions. No more spoilers ;)

For potential contributors: please ramp up on DQNs prior to modifying code or submitting a pull request. You can begin here: https://www.overleaf.com/10478780kyqykqgymsfb#/39061672/

We will utilize environments in our forked repository of the OpenAI gym: https://github.com/davisliang/gym. The fork allows us to modify the directory structure and backend files. We recommend using this fork alongside the marsmission repo.
